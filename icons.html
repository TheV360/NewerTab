				<h1>Icons</h1>
				<p>They're a mess.</p>
				<p>Later, I'll add an easy icon UI, but for now you're stuck with a single text box. What URL do you put in the box? Let's find out.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Font Awesome icons</h2>
				<p>The best place to get icons is from Font Awesome icons. They have a bunch of free icons and logos you can use easily. To use their icons, first open <a href="https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet">the cheatsheet</a> and find an icon. Then, remember its name and find what section it's under.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If it's under brand icons, then write <code>img/brands.svg</code> in the text box.</li>
					<li>If it's under regular icons, then write <code>img/regular.svg</code> in the text box.</li>
					<li>If it's under solid icons, then write <code>img/solid.svg</code> in the text box.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>After that file name in the textbox, add a hashtag and the name of the icon you chose, like so: (don't add a space in-between!)</p>
				<code>img/brands.svg#reddit-alien</code>
				<p>Your icon should work now.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Everything else</h2>
				<p>You can also just put any .svg URL in and it'll work. Even data URIs will work.</p>
