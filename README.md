# NewerTab

[Go to NewerTab](https://thev360.github.io/NewerTab)

It's my new tab page, but it isn't held together with duct tape!

# Features

You can customize most settings by right clicking them. Some features may require you to edit JSON, but I'm going to change that soon.

* Pretty interface
* Customizable icons
* Customizable clock
* Backgrounds support (gradients & images)
* Nice selection of default images.
* Search bar with date

# To-do

* Customization UI, but not trash
* Little bit more polish
* More empty space in the ignore.js file. Ignore the ignore.js file. There's nothing in it.

# Credits

* That one frosted glass tutorial and the codepen of one person who did it
* Me for the CSS
