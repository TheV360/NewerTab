# NewerTab

It's my new tab page, but it isn't held together with duct tape!

# Features

Currently, the only way to customize it is to edit the settings object and save it.

* Customizable icons
* Customizable clock
* Backgrounds support (gradients & images)
* Search bar with date!

# To-do

* Customization UI, but not trash
