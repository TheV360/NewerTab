# NewerTab

It's my new tab page, but it isn't held together with duct tape!

# Features

Currently, the only way to customize it is to edit the settings object and save it.

* Customizable icons
* Customizable clock

# To-do

* Customization UI, but not trash (make it load fast)
* Backgrounds support (gradients & images)
* Better search (maybe a search button like last time)
