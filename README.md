# [NewerTab](https://thev360.github.io/NewerTab)

It's my new tab page, but it isn't held together with duct tape!

# Features

You can customize most settings by right clicking them. Some features may require you to edit JSON, but I'm going to fix that soon.

* Pretty interface
* Customizable everything! (backgrounds, icons, themes)
* Dark theme!
* Backgrounds support (gradients, images, top posts of subreddits, most recent posts of tumblr blogs)
* Backgrounds credit (author and link to page)
* Nice selection of default images.
* Search bar with date

# To-do

* ~~Custom CSS~~
* Background Wizard (make new JSON Background objects)
* ~~More polish, maybe animations?~~
* More empty space in the ignore.js file. Ignore the ignore.js file. There's nothing in it. (Will add items, fix map 2, remove existential crisis)
* ~~Migrate NewerTab CSS to SCSS, for easier maintaining.~~

# Known Issues

* Dark Reader completely breaks page. Disable for my github.io site anyway, it already has a dark theme.

# Custom CSS Samples

Google Chrome-style search bar (rounded edges)

```css
input#searchbox {
	padding: .5rem 1rem;
	border-radius: 1rem;
}
```
